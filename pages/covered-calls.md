# Our Platform: Solarium Finance Covered Call Options

On the Solarium Finance platform, we currently offer a specific type of option called a "Solana covered call." This section explains what Solana covered calls are and how they work on our platform. Please note that we are starting with whitelisted buyers for now, but plan to open up to more users in the future.

## What is a Covered Call?

A covered call is an options strategy where the option seller (writer) owns the underlying asset and sells call options on that asset. It's "covered" because the seller owns the asset they might be obligated to sell.

## How Covered Calls Work on Our Platform

1. **Option Creation**:

   - A token holder (the seller) offers to sell their tokens at a specific price in the future.
   - They set the strike price, expiration date, and the number of tokens they're willing to sell.

2. **Option Purchase**:

   - A buyer can reserve the right to buy these tokens by paying a small fee (premium).
   - The premium is immediately transferred to the seller.

3. **Option Execution**:

   - The buyer can choose to buy the tokens at the agreed price before the expiration date.
   - If exercised, the tokens are transferred to the buyer, and the strike price is paid to the seller.

4. **Expiration**:
   - If the option is not exercised before expiration, it becomes worthless.
   - The seller keeps both the premium and their tokens.

## Benefits of Covered Calls

For Sellers:

- Generate additional income from tokens they already own.
- Potentially sell tokens at a price higher than the current market price.

For Buyers:

- Opportunity to buy tokens at a predetermined price.
- Limited risk (loss is capped at the premium paid).

## Risks of Covered Calls

For Sellers:

- Opportunity cost if the token price rises significantly above the strike price.
- Obligation to sell at the strike price if the option is exercised.

For Buyers:

- Loss of the premium if the option is not exercised.
- Limited profit potential compared to owning the token outright.
