# For Sellers: Creating and Managing Options

As a seller on the Solarium Finance platform, you have the opportunity to create covered call options on your tokens. This guide will walk you through the process of creating an option and managing it.

## Creating an Option

1. **Navigate to Create Option**:

   - From the main dashboard, click on "Create Option" or "Sell Option".

2. **Select Base Asset**:

   - Choose which token you want to sell (the base asset).
   - Ensure you have sufficient balance of this token.

3. **Set Option Details**:

   - Quantity: Set how many tokens you're offering.
   - Strike Price: Decide on a selling price (in another token, the quote asset).
   - Expiration Date: Set when the option will expire if not exercised.
   - Premium: Set the fee buyers will pay for the option (or use suggested market rate).

4. **Review and Confirm**:

   - Double-check all details before confirming.
   - The platform will show you potential outcomes based on your settings.

5. **Sign Transaction**:
   - Use your connected wallet to sign the transaction.
   - Your tokens will be transferred to the protocol's escrow.

## Managing Your Options

1. **View Active Options**:

   - Go to "My Options" or "Portfolio" to see your active options.

2. **Monitor Market Conditions**:

   - Keep an eye on the current price of your base asset.
   - Consider how it compares to your strike price.

3. **Wait for Outcomes**:
   - Option Bought: You'll receive the premium immediately.
   - Option Exercised: You'll receive the agreed strike price for your tokens.
   - Option Expired: Your tokens will be returned to you, and you keep the premium.

## Strategies and Tips

- Consider setting strike prices slightly above current market price for potential upside.
- Be aware of any upcoming events that might affect token price before setting expiration dates.
- Start with smaller amounts to get familiar with the system.
- Remember, while you earn the premium, you might miss out on significant price increases above your strike price.

## Risks to Consider

- Opportunity Cost: If the token price rises significantly above your strike price, you're obligated to sell at the lower price.
- Market Risk: The value of your tokens could decrease, potentially making your option less attractive to buyers.
- Smart Contract Risk: While we strive for security, all blockchain interactions carry some level of smart contract risk.

By understanding these aspects of creating and managing options, you can make informed decisions as a seller on our platform. Always consider your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance when creating options.
