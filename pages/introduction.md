# Introduction to Options

Options are financial contracts that give you the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specific price within a set time period. They're like reserving the opportunity to make a purchase or sale in the future. Our platform currently offers Solana covered calls, with more options coming soon.

## Key Concepts

1. **Underlying Asset**: The asset (in our case, a token) that the option is based on.
2. **Strike Price**: The price at which the asset can be bought or sold.
3. **Expiration Date**: The last day on which the option can be exercised.
4. **Premium**: The price paid to purchase an option.
5. **Call Option**: Gives the right to buy the asset.
6. **Put Option**: Gives the right to sell the asset.

## Why Trade Options?

1. **Leverage**: Control a large amount of assets with a small initial investment.
2. **Risk Management**: Protect your portfolio against market fluctuations.
3. **Income Generation**: Earn premiums by selling options.
4. **Speculation**: Profit from market movements without owning the underlying asset.

## Options vs. Futures

While both are derivative contracts, options give the holder the right but not the obligation to buy or sell, whereas futures contracts obligate both parties to transact at the future date.

## Risks and Considerations

- Options can expire worthless, resulting in a loss of the premium paid.
- The value of options can be affected by various factors including price movements of the underlying asset, time decay, and changes in volatility.
- Options trading can be complex and may not be suitable for all investors.

Understanding these basics will help you navigate the world of options trading on our Solana-based platform.
