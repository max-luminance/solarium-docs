   - Click on an option to view its details.
   - Review the following carefully:
     - Base Asset: The token you'll have the right to buy.
     - Quantity: How many tokens the option covers.
     - Strike Price: The price you'll pay per token if you exercise the option.
     - Expiration Date: When the option will expire if not exercised.
     - Premium: The cost to buy this option.

3. **Purchase the Option**:

## Managing Your Options

1. **View Purchased Options**:

   - Go to "My Options" or "Portfolio" to see your active options.

2. **Monitor Market Conditions**:

   - Keep an eye on the current price of the base asset.
   - Compare it to your option's strike price.

3. **Decide Whether to Exercise**:
   - You can exercise the option any time before expiration if it's profitable.
   - It's typically profitable to exercise when the current market price is higher than your strike price.

## Exercising an Option

1. **Navigate to the Option**:

   - Find the option you want to exercise in your portfolio.

2. **Choose to Exercise**:

   - Click "Exercise Option".
   - Review the details, including how many tokens you'll receive and the total cost.

3. **Confirm Exercise**:

   - Ensure you have enough funds to cover the strike price.
   - Sign the transaction with your wallet.

4. **Receive Tokens**:
   - Once the transaction is confirmed, you'll receive the tokens in your wallet.

## Strategies and Tips

- Consider the current market price, potential price movements, and time until expiration when deciding to exercise.
- You don't have to hold until expiration; you can exercise any time if it's profitable.
- Remember, if you don't exercise a profitable option, it will be automatically exercised at expiration in most cases.

## Risks to Consider

- Premium Loss: If the option expires out-of-the-money, you lose the premium paid.
- Opportunity Cost: The funds used to buy the option could have been used elsewhere.
- Market Risk: The value of the underlying asset could move unfavorably.
